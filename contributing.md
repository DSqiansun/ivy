* Bug reports are always welcome.

* Feature requests are welcome too, although I'll probably say no. My goal is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible.

* As a general rule I won't accept unsolicited pull requests. If you want to send a pull request check with me first to avoid wasting your time.

* This is a hobby project that I enjoy working on when I have free time. I probably don't want your code because I like writing it myself too much!

* If you do want to hack on Ivy, consider writing an extension or even forking the repository and using it as the basis for your own personalized static site generator. Remember, all of Ivy's code has been placed in the public domain so you can do whatever you like with it, no attribution required.
