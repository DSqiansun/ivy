* Bug reports are always welcome.

* Feature requests are welcome too, although I'll probably say no. My goal is to keep Ivy as small and simple as possible.

* I won't accept pull requests on this repository. This is a hobby project that I enjoy working on when I have time. I don't want your code because I like writing it myself too much!

* If you do want to dig into Ivy's code, consider writing an extension or even forking the repository and using it as the basis for your own personalized static site generator. Remember, all the code has been placed in the public domain so you can do whatever you want with it, no attribution required.
